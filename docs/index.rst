Welcome to aiobitcoin's documentation!
======================================
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a form of electronic cash.
It is a decentralized digital currency without a central
bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to
user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need
for intermediaries.

Transactions are verified by network nodes through
cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger
called a blockchain. Bitcoin was invented by an unknown
person or group of people using the name, Satoshi Nakamoto,
and released as open-source software in 2009. Bitcoins are
created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can
be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.
Research produced by University of Cambridge estimates that
in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a
cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.

Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal
transactions, its high electricity consumption, price
volatility, thefts from exchanges, and the possibility
that bitcoin is an economic bubble. Bitcoin has also
been used as an investment, although several regulatory
agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.
